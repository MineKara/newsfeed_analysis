## Project Overview<a name="project-overview"></a>
This project focuses on analyzing user interaction patterns with the Newsfeed service using Tableau. 
The Newsfeed feature is a dynamic part of the website that updates with new content, displaying the latest news or activities to encourage user engagement. 
The analysis period spans from January 1, 2023, to May 31, 2023. </br>

The main objective is to generate visualizations that capture critical insights into 
how users engage with automated and manual posts on the Newsfeed. By examining these interactions, we aim to identify which type of content resonates 
more with the audience and provide recommendations to optimize the Newsfeed feature for enhanced user engagement and community building.

The dashboard link has been added to the Tableau Public website.
